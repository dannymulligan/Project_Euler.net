Solve by calculating a line in the form Y = mX+c for each of the 3
sides of the triangle, then check to see which side of the line the
other vertex of the triangle was on, and then see if the origin was on
the same side.

Ran into problems with divide by zero when two points had the same X
coordinate, solved by swapping X & Y cordinates.
