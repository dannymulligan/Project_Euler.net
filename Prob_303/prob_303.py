#
# Multiples with small digits
#
# For a positive integer n, define f(n) as the least positive multiple
# of n that, written in base 10, uses only digits <= 2.
#
# Thus f(2)=2, f(3)=12, f(7)=21, f(42)=210, f(89)=1121222.
#
# Also, the sum of n from 1 to 100 of f(n)/n is 11363107.
#
# Find the sum of n from 1 to 10,000 of f(n)/n.
