# Frictionless Tube
#
# Consider a horizontal frictionless tube with length L millimetres,
# and a diameter of 20 millimetres. The east end of the tube is open,
# while the west end is sealed. The tube contains N marbles of
# diameter 20 millimetres at designated starting locations, each one
# initially moving either westward or eastward with common speed v.
#
# Since there are marbles moving in opposite directions, there are
# bound to be some collisions. We assume that the collisions are
# perfectly elastic, so both marbles involved instantly change
# direction and continue with speed v away from the collision
# site. Similarly, if the west-most marble collides with the sealed
# end of the tube, it instantly changes direction and continues
# eastward at speed v. On the other hand, once a marble reaches the
# unsealed east end, it exits the tube and has no further interaction
# with the remaining marbles.
#
# To obtain the starting positions and initial directions, we use the
# pseudo-random sequence r[j] defined by:
# r[1] = 6563116
# r[j+1]= r[j]^2 mod 32745673
#
# The west-most marble is initially positioned with a gap of
#    (r[1] mod 1000) + 1 millimetres
# between it and the sealed end of the tube, measured from the
# west-most point of the surface of the marble. Then, for 2 <= j<= N,
# counting from the west, the gap between the (jâˆ’1)th and jth marbles,
# as measured from their closest points, is given by (rjmod1000)+1
# millimetres. Furthermore, the jth marble is initially moving
# eastward if r[j] <= 10000000, and westward if r[j]>10000000.
#
# For example, with N=3, the sequence specifies gaps of 117, 432, and
# 173 millimetres. The marbles' centres are therefore 127, 579, and
# 772 millimetres from the sealed west end of the tube. The west-most
# marble initially moves eastward, while the other two initially move
# westward.
#
# Under this setup, and with a five metre tube (L=5000), it turns out
# that the middle (second) marble travels 5519 millimetres before its
# centre reaches the east-most end of the tube.
#
# Let d(L,N,j) be the distance in millimetres that the jth marble
# travels before its centre reaches the eastern end of the tube. So
# d(5000,3,2)=5519. You are also given that d(10000,11,6)=11780 and
# d(100000,101,51)=114101.
#
# Find d(1000000000,1000001,500001)
