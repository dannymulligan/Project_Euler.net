#
# Maximizing a weighted product
#
# Let Sm = (x1, x2, ... , xm) be the m-tuple of positive real numbers
# with x1 + x2 + ... + xm = m for which Pm = x1 * x2^2 * ... * xm^m is
# maximised.
#
# For example, it can be verified that [P10] = 4112 (where [ ] is the
# integer part function).
#
# Find Sum[Pm] for 2 <= m <= 15.
