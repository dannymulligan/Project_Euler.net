# Sum of squares of divisors
#
# The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3 and 6.
# The sum of the squares of these numbers is 1+4+9+36=50.
#
# Let sigma2(n) represent the sum of the squares of the divisors of
# n. Thus sigma2(6)=50.
#
# Let SIGMA2 represent the summatory function of sigma2, that is
# SIGMA2(n)=âˆ‘sigma2(i) for i=1 to n.
# The first 6 values of SIGMA2 are: 1,6,16,37,63 and 113.
#
# Find SIGMA2(10^15) modulo 10^9.
