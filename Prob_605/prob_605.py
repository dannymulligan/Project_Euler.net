# Pairwise Coin-Tossing Game
#
# Consider an n-player game played in consecutive pairs: Round 1 takes
# place between players 1 and 2, round 2 takes place between players 2
# and 3, and so on and so forth, all the way up to round n, which
# takes place between players n and 1. Then round n+1 takes place
# between players 1 and 2 as the entire cycle starts again.
#
# In other words, during round r, player ((râˆ’1) mod n)+1 faces off
# against player (r mod n)+1
#
# During each round, a fair coin is tossed to decide which of the two
# players wins that round. If any given player wins both rounds r and
# r+1, then that player wins the entire game.
#
# Let Pn(k) be the probability that player k wins in an n-player game,
# in the form of a reduced fraction. For example, P3(1)=12/49 and
# P6(2)=368/1323
#
# Let Mn(k) be the product of the reduced numerator and denominator of
# Pn(k). For example, M3(1)=588 and M6(2)=486864
#
# Find the last 8 digits of M10^8 + 7(10^4 + 7).
