# Firecracker
#
# A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It
# breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which move in
# every direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of 20
# m/s.
#
# We assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a
# uniform gravitational field with g=9.81 m/s^2.
#
# Find the volume (in m^3) of the region through which the fragments
# move before reaching the ground. Give your answer rounded to four
# decimal places.
