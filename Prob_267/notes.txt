In my first attempt to solve this problem, I misread the instructions.
I thought that the outcome was 1+f for heads, and 1-f for tails, when
in fact it was 1+2f & 1-f.  This caused my solution to be wrong, and I
would probably have thrashed around for a long time looking for the
soution were it not for the fact that I was able to find a solution
online.  And this represents one of the biggest frustrations when
solving these problems... what do you do when you think you have the
right answer, but you don't.  Here are a few suggestions...

- Reread the problem description thoroughly.

- The problem description typicaly includes a small example, you
  should try out your solution on that small example and see if you
  solution matches the solution given.

- Look for a simpler 'brute-force' algorithm that solves the same
  problem, and then try it out on a smaller version of the problem.
  Use the answer given to further test your more efficienct (but more
  complicated) algorithm.

The key to solving this problem is to recognize that although there
are 2^1000 distinct permutations of heads and tails, the only thing
that matters is the number of heads & tails - the order in which they
arrive is irrelevant.  Whenever you get a heads, then your capital is
multiplied by...

    1+2*f

...and whenever you get a tails, your capital is multipled by...

    1-f

So after a sequence of N heads, and 1000-N tails, your capital will be...

    C(N) = (1+2*f)^N * (1-f)^(1000-N)

If we can find a value of f for which this results in a final capital
of greater than 1,000,000,000 at some N, then higher values of N will
result in even larger results, so our goal must be to find the
smallest N for which there exists a value of f that results in a final
capital greater than 1,000,000,000.

In other words, find the smallest N for which there exists an f
with...

    C(N) = (1+2*f)^N * (1-f)^(1000-N) > 1,000,000,000

If we work in logarithms, the analysis will be easier, so restating
the problem, we need the smallest N for which there exists an f
with...

    Cl(N) = N*log(1+2*f) * (1000-N)*log(1-f) > log(1,000,000,000)
