# Investigating isosceles triangle for which the height and base
# length differ by one.
#
# Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, b = 16, and legs,
# L = 17.
#
#               .

#               b
#  
# By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of
# the triangle, h = sqrt(17^2 âˆ’ 8^2) = 15, which is one less than the
# base length.
#
# With b = 272 and L = 305, we get h = 273, which is one more than the
# base length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with
# the property that h = b +/- 1.
#
# Find sum(L) for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which h
# = b +/- 1 and b, L are positive integers.
#
# Solved ??/??/10
# ?? problems solved
# Position #??? on level ?

# L, b & h are all integer
# b/2 is also integer, therefore b must be even
# h = b +/-1, therefore h must be odd
