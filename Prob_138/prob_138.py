# Investigating isosceles triangle for which the height and base
# length differ by one.
#
# Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, b = 16, and legs,
# L = 17.
#
#            .
#           /|\
#          / | \
#       L /  |  \ L
#        /  h|   \
#       /    |    \
#      /     |     \
#     ---------------
#           b
#  
# By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of
# the triangle, h = sqrt(17^2 âˆ’ 8^2) = 15, which is one less than the
# base length.
#
# With b = 272 and L = 305, we get h = 273, which is one more than the
# base length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with
# the property that h = b +/- 1.
#
# Find sum(L) for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which h
# = b +/- 1 and b, L are positive integers.
