Another pretty simple problem to solve.

Here's the solution in python: <prob_002.py>

This one takes 0.027 seconds to run on my laptop.  By the way, most of
this time is taken up with just starting the python interpreter
itself, running python on an empty file takes almost as long at 0.025
seconds.

As with Problem 1, if this problem was a lot larger we would have
needed to come up with a more efficient algorithm to solve it, but it
wasn't so we didn't.  When we get to problem 104, we'll be forced to
come up with a more efficient algorithm for finding Fibonacci numbers.
