#
# The hyperexponentiation of a number
#
# The hyperexponentiation or tetration of a number a by a positive
# integer b, denoted by a^^b or ^(b)a, is recursively defined by:
#
#     a^^1 = a,
#     a^^(k+1) = a^(a^^k).
#
# Thus we have e.g. 3^^2 = 3^3 = 27, hence 3^^3 = 3^27 = 7625597484987
# and 3^^4 is roughly 10^(3.6383346400240996*10^12).
#
# Find the last 8 digits of 1777^^1855.
