Problem 85

By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular grid measuring
3 by 2 contains eighteen rectangles:

 6 1x1 rectangles
 4 2x1 rectangles
 2 3x1 rectangles
 3 1x2 rectangles
 2 2x2 rectangles
 1 3x2 rectangles

Although there exists no rectangular grid that contains exactly two
million rectangles, find the area of the grid with the nearest
solution.
