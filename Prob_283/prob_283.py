#
# Integer sided triangles for which the area/perimeter ratio is integral.
#
# Consider the triangle with sides 6, 8 and 10. It can be seen that
# the perimeter and the area are both equal to 24. So the
# area/perimeter ratio is equal to 1.
#
# Consider also the triangle with sides 13, 14 and 15. The perimeter
# equals 42 while the area is equal to 84. So for this triangle the
# area/perimeter ratio is equal to 2.
#
# Find the sum of the perimeters of all integer sided triangles for
# which the area/perimeter ratios are equal to positive integers not
# exceeding 1000.
