# The Chase II
#
# Consider the following variant of "The Chase" game. This game is
# played between n players sitting around a circular table using two
# dice. It consists of nâˆ’1 rounds, and at the end of each round one
# player is eliminated and has to pay a certain amount of money into a
# pot. The last player remaining is the winner and receives the entire
# contents of the pot.
#
# At the beginning of a round, each die is given to a randomly
# selected player. A round then consists of a number of turns.
#
# During each turn, each of the two players with a die rolls it. If a
# player rolls a 1 or a 2, she passes the die to her neighbour on the
# left; if she rolls a 5 or a 6, she passes the die to her neighbour
# on the right; otherwise, she keeps the die for the next turn.
#
# The round ends when one player has both dice at the beginning of a
# turn. The turn is aborted, that player is eliminated, and she has to
# pay s^2 where s is the number of completed turns in this round. Note
# that if both dice happen to be handed to the same player at the
# beginning of a round, then no turns are completed, so the player is
# eliminated without having to pay any money into the pot.
#
# Let G(n) be the expected amount that the winner will receive. For
# example G(5) is approximately 96.544, and G(50) is 2.82491788e6 in
# scientific notation rounded to 9 significant digits.
#
# Find G(500), giving your answer in scientific notation rounded to 9
# significant digits.
